### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This is an amazing guide from [*Chris House*](https://css-tricks.com/author/caiman/) which helped me understand how to use the CSS Grid. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
